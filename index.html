<h2>Library</h2>
<p>
x-x is an <em>library</em> of modules and <em>not a framework</em>. With a
framework you often must choose to use everything or nothing, as the framework manages the basic control flow and then calls you.
With x-x <em>you</em> stay in control. Define the control flow your self and pick
only those x-x modules as buildings blocks you like and combine them with other ones as you please.

<h2>Stay Stateless</h2>
<p>
A main architectural principle is to create a stateless server. While
the backends may store data and are stefull, the web server inbetween should be stateless:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>All information to answer a request is reconstructed from the
	request itself: the verb, url, parameters, body and headers</li>
	<li>We do not require single global session. One <em>can</em> however use
	<em>web caching</em> and <em>cookies</em> to improve the speed. But
	these must always be <em>optional</em>, thus the functional behavior
	stays the same with or without cache</li>
	<li>Use <em>always</em> Vary-Headers to indicate which headers of
	the incoming request determined the response and use cache control headers to indicate how
	long the resource can be cached.</li>
	<li>Follow the REST principles and understand <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html">HTTP GET/POST/PUT/DELETE</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Why?</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Scalability</b><p>By keeping a system stateless it scales
	better: A load balancer can send a request to <em>any</em> of the
	set of balanced servers, no cookie stickiness needed. The cookie
	value is not just meaningful for a single server as with a single
	session. Even in a cluster with shared session data, <em>every</em> session cookie based
	request results in an overhead. In a stateless system one can
	switch on or off nodes immediately. There are no issues for users
	with lost sessions or timeouts.</p>
	</li>
	<li><b>Speed</b> by caching: <p>A global session cookie makes it
	difficult and often impossible to cache request results: It is not
	obvious from the request itself if a particular request will change
	the session state or not, thereby you can only decide to not cache
	the page. Example: think of a shopping page that shows products p.e. smartphones as result of a product search.
	Assume the product search allows the user to optionally define some filter criteria. p.e. a price range.
	If the filter criteria is stored in a session, then each request
	will require a session cookie to enable the server to deliver only those products within
	the price range.
	But with this statefull design it is impossible to see from the
	outside if the request GET /search?q=iphone  depends on filter criteria or not.
	Therefore we can <em>never</em> cache the result in a HTTP cache. Each
	request <em>must</em> go through the web server, only the server
	knows what is in the global session. 
	Thus even if it is likely that hunderd thousands of people just
	search for "iphone" without using any filter criteria we can not
	deliver a cached result.
	</p><p>
	Such a design often also limits indexing by search engines.
	</p>
	<p>The correct way of handling this, is to not require a session cookie at all, and to add the filter criteria in each request as a parameter.
	<em>Always pass only the state needed to answer the request an
	nothing more, and indicate what was used (Vary-headers, url,
	method).</em></p>
	</li>

	<li><b>Testability</b>:<p>A single global session leads to systems
	where you need to perform whole series of requests in a certain
	order to create a state as test precondition. In a stateless system
	a <em>single</em> request (p.e. from a command line) always will return the same response. 
	So besides getting maybe a login credential only a <em>single</em>
	HTTP call is needed to check if something is working or not.</p>
	</li>

	<li><b>Robustness</b>:<p>Removing cookies or shutting down a server
	side cache does maybe effect the speed but does not cause the system to stop working.
	Stateless servers have a better failover capability: A failing node
	behind the load balancer can immediately be replaced without any
	interruption by another node.</p>
	</li>

	<li><b>User satisfaction</b>:<p>Scalable cachable systems can improve the
	response times significantly. The risk ot traffic peaks and thereby slow
	a service leading to a bad image and lost sales is reduced. There
	are less lost shopping baskets because the mobile connection was broken for while.
	No lost sessions on server failover or restarts.</p></li>

</ul>
<p>Inferior frameworks often hide al this &quot;uncomfortable&quot; caching
	scaling stateless stuff from the developers. So they can focus on
	the &quot;important&quot; stuff. It so much easier to dump everything in the global session.
	You often then hear: &quot;I thought the framework should handle
	that. Why is caching so important anyway. Caching is just
	optimising. We simply buy more hardware instead of spending
	&quot;valuable&quot; time on this.
	We should concentrate on business functionality&quot; that is value.
	We can put in a cache in the backend lateron.
</p>
<p>
	Ignoring the effect of scaling and web caching however is a very major failure which only low traffic web sites can afford:
	Example: Assume the likely effect that a web cache speeds up a HTTP request from
	p.e. 1.5 sec to p.e. 150 ms. During development without any caching and using
	mocks the developer will never “feel” a big difference. Ignore
	caching from the begining and the developer is very likely to break the scaling and
	caching capabilities of a website.
	Caching could however could have allowed the run the website <b>10 times</b> faster or run the server
	with <b>10 times more users</b> or may be just save <b>90%</b> of the current hardware costs.
	While this mayby are just missed oportunities you do not really miss,
	breaking cachability can also mean significant losses:
	On a traffic peak caused by a release date, ad campaign, press
	release (p.e. a new iphone), it can be very very difficult to setup suddenly 10 times as much
hardware in case the design failure caused that you <em>can not
	cache</em> at all, and you can't fix it. This leads to real lost
sales.
</p><p>
Thus Instead of ignoring the basic architectural principles which
allowed the web to scale, a so called &quot;web&quot;-developer should better try to learn the web basics instead of hiding behind a framework.
</p>

<p>
Note: x-x does <em>not ensure</em> you get such scalable websites, but as it
is build around basic HTTP request/response handling it may lead to a better HTTP awareness.
At least it doesn’t get in your way, making it impossible to handle a
HTTP request the way you want.

<h2>Composing middlewares to pipelines</h2>
<p>
Applications are build as pipelines consisting of express middleware modules. We use the middleware as the main element to compose applications.
</p>
<p>
A HTTP request comes in and routing based on the url decides the
pipeline to use, in the pipeline we then do the following:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Check some headers</li>
	<li>Check if an authorisation is needed</li>
	<li>Call a backend to check the user credentials</li>
	<li>Get some user specific data from backends</li>
	<li>If it is a POST/PUT Request:
		<ul>
			<li>Check requirements to create/modify the resource</li>
			<li>Validate the requested input/changes</li>
			<li>If that validation fails, render a response with feedback and
			return that to the client.</li>
 		<li>Call backends to create a resource or retrieve the source, change it, and store it</li>
		</ul>	
	</li>
	<li>Get some requested resource data from backends</li>
	<li>Render a representation p.e HTML or JSON or perform a redirect</li>
	<li>Format compress the response</li>
	<li>Set some cache control headers</li>
	<li>Send the response to the client</li>
</ul>
<p>
All these steps can be defined as asynchronous middlewares. 
By using a middleware as the basic building block with a uniform interface, it becomes easy to mix functionalities and prevent the so called call back hell.
</p>
</section>

<h2>Module categories</h2>
<p>
we provide different categories of modules:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>x-util</b>: a x-util module provides some kind of basic
	functionality as normally found in libraries</li>

	<li><b>x-middlewares</b>: a collection of express middleware which often
	provide functionality provided by the x-util modules as middlewares.
	Data is passed from one middleware to the next via the properties of
	the request or data object.</li>

	<li><b>x-app</b>: here we have some little apps to demonstrate the use of
	the middlewares.</li>

	<li><b>x-server</b>: contains some helpers to manage a set of apps together
	on a server, run them in production mode with the clusterize
	module.</li>
</ul>
